About me
======
I am an Standardization Engineer of video coding at **The Creative Life (TCL), Shenzhen**. 
I obtained BS in IEE from **Shenzhen University** under the supervision of prof. [Miaohui Wang](https://charwill.github.io/).
Currently, my recent interests include video compression, image processing and machine learning.
